# Graph Drawing Application using Qt Framework

- This Graph Drawing Application is built using the Qt framework and allows users to create and manipulate graphs interactively. Users can add nodes by right-clicking on the canvas, create edges between nodes by right-clicking on two nodes consecutively, and move existing nodes by left-clicking and dragging them. Additionally, the application prevents node overlapping to ensure clarity and readability of the graph.

## Features:

## 1. Interactive Graph Creation:

- Users can add nodes to the canvas by right-clicking on empty areas.
## 2. Edge Creation:

- Users can create edges between nodes by right-clicking on one node and then right-clicking on another node.
## 3. Node Movement:

- Existing nodes can be moved by left-clicking and dragging them to a new position on the canvas.
## 4. Prevention of Node Overlapping:

- The application prevents nodes from overlapping, ensuring that each node is clearly distinguishable.
### How to Use:

- Right-click on the canvas to add nodes.
- Right-click on two nodes consecutively to create an edge between them.
- Left-click and drag existing nodes to move them to a new position.
### Note: This application is a simple and intuitive tool for creating and manipulating graphs interactively. It provides a user-friendly interface for visualizing and editing graph structures.
